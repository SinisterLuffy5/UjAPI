## FAQ

1. Will it support Reforged natives?
  Most of them will be added soon, supporting all of them is impossible.
2. Will you add DzAPI/JN/EX natives support?
  Most of them are already supported, unsafe natives like SetMemory, GetModuleHandle are not and will never be supported.
3. Will it support Reforged maps directly?
  Not in the near future and 100% support is impossible anyways, for now that is not my main focus.
4. Can you add X patch support?
  Anything for a price, but honestly, having 5 major patches support should be more than enough.
5. Will you add 1.29.2 support?
  Same answer as #4, but this one may make some sense to a degree, and considering a big "change" in files/memory, it's quite a hassle.
6. What is this project for?
  Mostly my own self-made challenge to make what NetEase did (but in a more elegant way) and to just see if I can reverse-engineer the game to a degree, where I can freely add whatever I can think of.
7. Are you interested in working for Blizzard, perhaps?
  Always has been my dream, but considering the latest events, I would first wait out the storm, until some changes are made there to even consider trying to get hired there. But, it's hard to imagine them to be interested in me in particular, but who knows.
