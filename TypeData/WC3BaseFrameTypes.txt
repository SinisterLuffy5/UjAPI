// DEFAULT BASE FRAME TYPES

"BASE" // Crashes, probably not handled correctly, or not suitable for usage on its own.
"LAYER" // Not a real type, but is used in FRAME as its base structure.
"FRAME" // Extends LAYER, serves as base for any and all frames. Internal name COMPLEXFRAME.

"MODEL" // Extends FRAME, facilitates models, not really used on its own.
"BACKDROP" // Extends MODEL, serves as "base" to facilitate textures, the rest copies logic of MODEL.

"HIGHLIGHT" // Extends FRAME, facilitates texture and is used to "highlight" another frame, frames that support highlighting usually have 2 of them, one for HOVER and one for FOCUS.

"SPRITE" // Extends FRAME, which is used mainly for displaying models, such as Cooldown or even portrait (Portrait in fact extends BUTTON, which extends CONTROL).
"STATUSBAR" // Extends SPRITE, which is used for cooldown drawing, this allows for easier control of current animation percent, whereas SPRITE doesn't.
"CONTROL" // Extends SPRITE, serves as a base frame type for most of the internal frames.

"TEXT" // Extends CONTROL, this contans texts which can be multi-line.
"TIMERTEXT" // Extends TEXT, contains CEventTimer (probably for countdown), the rest is fully equal to TEXT.
"BUTTON" // Extends CONTROL, serves as a "container" for multiple BACKDROPs, these serve as states (i.e. textures).
"GLUEBUTTON" // Extends BUTTON, allows this frame to be "glued" to SIMPLEFRAME and its children, the rest is fully equal to BUTTON.
"TEXTBUTTON" // Extends BUTTON, simply adds TEXT as a child frame, the rest is fully equal to BUTTON.
"GLUETEXTBUTTON" // Extends TEXTBUTTON, allows this frame to be "glued" to SIMPLEFRAME and its children, the rest is fully equal to TEXTBUTTON.
"CHECKBOX" // Extends BUTTON, adds CHECKED/UNCHECKED states over default, the rest is fully equal to BUTTON.
"GLUECHECKBOX" // Extends CHECKBOX, allows this frame to be "glued" to SIMPLEFRAME and its children, the rest is fully equal to CHECKBOX.
"LISTBOXITEM" // Extends TEXT and serves as a basic frame, this can actually contain a frame inside of itself.
"LISTBOX" // Facilitates LISTBOXITEMs, in a SCROLLFRAME with a SCROLLBAR.
"MENU" // Facilitates LISTBOXITEMs, similar to LISTBOX, but has no SCROLLBAR, used in POPUPMENU.
"POPUPMENU" // Facilitates TEXT inside of itself and creates child MENU.
"GLUEPOPUPMENU" // Extends POPUPMENU, allows this frame to be "glued" to SIMPLEFRAME and its children, the rest is fully equal to POPUPMENU.

"SCROLL" // Extends FRAME, facilitates frames on itself and allows SLIDER/SCROLLBAR to navigate through it.
"SLIDER" // Extends CONTROL, serves as percentage navigation on SCROLL when BUTTON frame is moved.
"SCROLLBAR" // Extends SLIDER, copies the logic of SLIDER but also adds "arrows" up and down for additional way of navigation.
"DIALOG" // Extends FRAME, serves as a base for frames like TimerDialog and even LeaderBoard.
"CHATDISPLAY" // Probably used in Battle.net/Local Game lobbies.
"TEXTAREA" // Extends CONTROL, facilitates TEXT frames, additionally can have a SCROLLBAR.
"EDITBOX" // Extends CONTROL, contains multiple TEXT frames, mainly used to "send" written text or utilise it in some way.
"GLUEEDITBOX" // Extends EDITBOX, allows this frame to be "glued" to SIMPLEFRAME and its children, the rest is fully equal to EDITBOX.
"SLASHCHATBOX" // Extends EDITBOX, has an additional event tied to it and its structure is slightly bigger than EDITBOX, the rest is fully equal to EDITBOX.
"LISTBUTTON" // Extends CONTROL, seems like a way to contain BUTTONs in a "top-down list".
"RADIOGROUP" // Extends CONTROL, facilitates CHECKBOX, only 1 CHECKBOX can be active at a time, used in chat frame, where you decide to whom chat message is supposed to be sent, i.e. "all/allies/private".
"MESSAGE" // Extends FRAME, facilitates TEXT, example would be CChatDialog or CLodDialog.

"SIMPLETOP" // Frame that facilitates all CSimpleRegion and CSimpleFrame based frames.
"SIMPLEFRAME" // Base for all SimpleFrames apart from SIMPLETEXT and SIMPLETEXTURE neither is available via default API, UjAPI got you covered.
"SIMPLEGRID" // Extends SIMPLEFRAME. Allows to create actual "grid", this simply controls the placement of items based on rows/columns and total width/height.
"SIMPLESTATUSBAR" // Used for HP/MB bars.
"SIMPLEBUTTON" // Extends SIMPLEFRAME. Logically same as CONTROL, but based on SIMPLEFRAME.
"SIMPLECHECKBOX" // Extends SIMPLEBUTTON. Logically same as CHECKBOX, but based on SIPLEFRAME.
"SIMPLEMESSAGEFRAME" // Extends SIMPLEFRAME, a simpler version of MESSAGE. Used for basic DisplayTextToPlayer, etc.

// UjAPI BASE FRAME TYPES

"SIMPLETEXT" // Extends CSimpleRegion (no base name). Logically similar to TEXT, but based on CSimpleRegion.
"SIMPLETEXTURE" // Extends CSimpleRegion (no base name). Logically similar to BACKDROP, but based on CSimpleRegion.
