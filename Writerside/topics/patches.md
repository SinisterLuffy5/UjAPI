    Priority:
        Highest: most of the focus, due to relevancy.
        High: similar to highest, only lower due to DirectX8.
        Medium: likely to receive attention.
        Low: crashes/bugs may receive attention.
        Lowest: supported, but without 100% bug/crash free experience.

    Support Status:
        Full: everything proven to work.
        Medium: issues exist, requires fixes.
        Low: mostly proven to be broken.

    Graphics:
        All Graphics features are focused on DirectX9.
        Patches that use DirectX8 won't receive graphical upgrades.
        OpenGL may, but not necessarily receive graphical upgrades.
